<h2>Design IRI-Patterns</h2>
I will use my first and last name in the domain address to makes it easier to everybody to remember my webpage. 
Hence I am Italian but born and raised in Switzerland, neither the top level domain .it nor the top level domain .ch makes really sense to me. That’s why I chose .com as my top level domain.

<h2>Linked Data</h2>
Linked data is the connection between single parts of raw material. I will take cars to make an example.
A car has different row data linked to it. We have a number for the strength, we have a size of the car, we have data about what full it needs etc. But this all is just data. One piece just sais “diesel” – this single data makes no sense yet.
Linked data gives this data a sense. It links “diesel” to a certain car. It is because of the link, that data is usable to us.
